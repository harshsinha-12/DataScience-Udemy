The Nifty formed a Doji candle on the daily chart near its all-time high, which may be signaling short-term hesitation ahead of the US Fed meeting due later this week with the Street expectations that it might start with an outsized rate cut.

Nifty formed a small sideways Doji candle resulting in three days of narrow range moves. Nifty is in the process of consolidating ahead of the big event. A breakout of the 25,292-25,442 band could result in a sharper move in that direction, said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.

What should traders do? Here’s what analysts said:

Rupak De, LKP Securities
A breakout from the recent range-bound pattern could provide a clear direction for the Nifty. Immediate support is at 25,350, and a fall below this level might lead to the unwinding of put option writing positions, potentially triggering a correction toward 25,000. On the upside, resistance is seen at 25,500, and a strong upward move may be expected if Nifty breaks above this level.

Hrishikesh Yedve, Asit C Mehta Investment Interrmediates
Technically, the index on a daily scale formed a doji candle near its all-time high, signaling some short-term hesitation. However, the fact that Nifty remained above 25,335 (the breakout level of the rounding bottom pattern) suggests underlying strength. The 21-DEMA support is currently placed near 25,060, which will act as the next major support for the index. As long as Nifty stays above 25,060, a "buy on dips" strategy is advisable, with the potential for the index to test 25,600 in the short term.

Tejas Shah, JM Financial & BlinkX
The rally is likely to continue and the Nifty can test the next resistance zone of 25,500-550 in the next couple of days. The short term moving averages are below the price action and should continue to support the indices on any / every decline. Support for Nifty is now seen at 25,350 and 25,200. On the higher side, the next crucial resistance zone is at 25,500-550 levels.
